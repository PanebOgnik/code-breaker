# code-breaker
A C-written game inspired by the popular logic game Mastermind, where the player must crack the code.
On the right side of the board, the player receives Hints: ‘X’ - the digit is in the code and in the correct position, ‘o’ - the digit is in the code but in the wrong position.
IMPORTANT! The display positions of the hints do not correspond to the positions in the code and are chosen randomly each time! Only the hint’s message is important, not its display position!
Good luck cracking the code! :)
